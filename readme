This is the code for a very simple blockchain using the concept that block is dependant on the hash of the previous block

any data can be converted to a hash. a hash is a uniqque set of numbers 
in blockchain each block contains 3 details
		the hash of the block
		the details of the block
		the hash of the previous block
because the hash of the previous block is there in the block if we do any change to a block the hashes of the blocks after that change as well
for example if any detail in block 2 is changed the hash of block 2 changes and so does the hash of block 3 as it is dependant on hash of block 2
the 1st block in a blockchain is known as he genesis block and because it doesn't have a block before it we have to  hardcode it



 	String[] list1 = {"a", "b" , "c"};
 	String[] list2 = {"aa", "b" , "c"};
 
 	System.out.println(Arrays.hashCode(list1));
 	System.out.println(Arrays.hashCode(list2));
 	
 if we execute this code we can see that we get very different hashes eventhough the different between these 2 are very minor
